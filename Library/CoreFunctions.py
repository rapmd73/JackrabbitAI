# This Python script is a collection of utility functions designed to handle
# various tasks, such as text processing, system monitoring, and input
# validation. It begins by importing several built-in Python modules, including
# those for system operations, file handling, date and time management, and
# regular expressions. Additionally, it imports a custom module named
# `DecoratorFunctions`, which likely contains decorators used to enhance or
# modify the behavior of the functions in this script.

# The script defines several global variables, including the name of the
# running script and a directory path for token storage. These variables are
# used throughout the script to maintain consistency and provide context for
# certain operations.

# One of the key functions, `DecodeHashCodes`, is designed to decode numeric
# character references in a string, such as `&#65;`, and replace them with
# their corresponding characters. It uses a regular expression to identify
# these patterns and a helper function to perform the conversion. Another
# function, `DecodeUnicode`, replaces various Unicode characters with their
# ASCII equivalents, making the text more compatible with systems that
# primarily use ASCII.

# The `Yesterday` function calculates the date of the previous day, either
# based on the current date or a provided date string. However, there appears
# to be a bug in this function, as it references an undefined variable instead
# of using the provided parameter correctly.

# Several functions are dedicated to system monitoring and resource management.
# `GetLoadAVG` retrieves the system's current load average by reading from a
# specific file, providing insight into the system's workload. The `renice`
# function adjusts the priority of the current process, allowing it to run at a
# higher or lower priority level, which can be useful for managing system
# resources. `ElasticSleep` introduces a delay in execution, optionally
# adjusting the sleep duration based on the system's load to prevent
# overloading. Similarly, `ElasticDelay` calculates a dynamic delay based on
# system load, ensuring that processes don't overwhelm the system.

# Text processing is another significant aspect of this script. The
# `NumberOnly` function validates whether a string represents a valid number,
# considering various numeric characters and look-alike symbols.
# `StripPunctuation` removes punctuation and high ASCII characters from text,
# replacing them with spaces to clean up the input. `jsonFilter` prepares a
# string for JSON processing by removing unwanted characters like newlines,
# tabs, and spaces. `GetWordList` processes a block of text into a list of
# lowercase words, removing any empty entries.

# Lastly, the `IsSTDIN` function checks if there is input available on the
# standard input within a one-second timeout. This is useful for determining
# whether a program should wait for user input or proceed with other tasks.

# The `DecodeHashCodes` function is designed to decode numeric character
# references in a given input string. It utilizes a regular expression to
# identify patterns such as `&#65;` and replaces them with their corresponding
# characters. The function achieves this through a helper function,
# `replace_entity`, which extracts the numeric value from each match, converts
# it to a character using the `chr` function, and returns the character. If the
# conversion fails, it returns the original match. The main function then
# applies this replacement process to the entire input string using `re.sub`,
# ultimately returning the decoded string.

# The `DecodeUnicode` function takes a string input `text` and replaces various

# single quotation marks, double quotation marks, en dashes, em dashes,
# ellipsis, and non-breaking spaces, to their ASCII counterparts. The function
# iterates through this dictionary, replacing each occurrence of the specified

# to determine a dynamic sleep duration. If the load is high, it reduces the
# process's priority and throttles the delay to prevent overloading the system.
# The sleep duration is then calculated based on the load average, with an
# additional throttle factor applied if the load exceeds the number of CPUs. If
