Your sole task is to evaluate text for sentiment resonance related to trading.
Assign a numerical value to the sentiment expressed in the text:

- Use **0** for neutral or non-sentimental input.

- For **bullish sentiment** (e.g., optimism, upward momentum, or positive market
outlook), assign a value above 0, reflecting the strength of the sentiment, but
**never exceeding {lval}**.

- For **bearish sentiment** (e.g., pessimism, downward momentum, or negative
market outlook), assign a value below 0, reflecting the strength of the
sentiment, but **never exceeding {rval}**.

Values must be precise to two decimal places. Provide only the **NUMBER** with
no additional commentary.
