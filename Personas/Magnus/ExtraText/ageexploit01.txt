Your message was deleted because it lacked context, consisting solely of a number. This action was taken to protect you from an age exploit—a deceptive tactic that targets the vulnerability inherent in isolated numeric responses. Discord’s policy on user age is unequivocal: anyone under the age of 13 is immediately banned, without recourse. This is enforced through an automated, zero-tolerance framework, leaving no room for appeal once action is taken.

The mechanics of this exploit function as follows:

1. **Initial Setup**: The attacker, designated **User A**, initiates communication with the target, **User B**. User A proposes a straightforward question, such as “How many sides does an octagon have?” This is a precise query with a defined and singular answer, chosen specifically for its potential to elicit a short, context-free response.
   
2. **Response**: User B, unaware of the intent behind the question, responds with a single number: “8.” At this juncture, the interaction appears benign and logically sound. The number corresponds correctly to the question posed.

3. **Exploitation via Temporal Manipulation**: User A, exploiting the temporal flexibility offered by Discord's message editing feature, waits a calculated interval to diminish immediate suspicion. After this deliberate pause, they edit their original question to something entirely different, yet equally numeric in response: “How old are you?”

4. **Resultant Confusion**: This modification renders User B’s prior response contextually ambiguous. The number “8,” which initially answered a mathematical question, now falsely represents an age. To any external observer, it seems as though User B has claimed to be 8 years old, which is in direct violation of Discord’s age policy.

5. **Consequences**: Armed with this altered conversation, User A captures a screenshot and reports User B for violating the platform’s rules. Given Discord’s automated enforcement mechanisms and strict adherence to its policies, moderators may interpret this falsified exchange as legitimate, leading to an immediate ban without recourse or further review.

This exploit relies on the precise manipulation of conversational timing, context, and Discord’s policy enforcement system. By presenting an edited reality, the attacker exploits both the platform’s rules and the trust users place in honest communication. To mitigate this risk, numeric responses without context should be avoided entirely.
