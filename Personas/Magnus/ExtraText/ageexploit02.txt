Your message was removed due to containing just a number without any explanation. This precaution was taken to protect you from a deceptive tactic known as an age exploit attack, which leverages isolated numeric responses. Discord's stringent age policy enforces an immediate ban on users under 13, and once issued, this ban cannot be contested or reversed.

Here’s how the age exploit attack works:

1. **The Setup**: An attacker, referred to as **User A**, begins by asking **User B** an innocent question, such as, “How many sides does a hexagon have?” This question is deliberately simple, encouraging **User B** to respond with a single number.

2. **The Innocent Reply**: **User B** responds with “6,” accurately answering the initial question. At this stage, the interaction seems harmless, as it appears to be a normal exchange of information.

3. **The Exploit**: After waiting long enough to avoid suspicion, **User A** edits their original message, changing it to something far more dangerous, like “How old are you?” Now, with **User B’s** answer still showing as “6,” it appears that **User B** has claimed to be 6 years old.

4. **The Trap is Set**: With the altered conversation in place, **User A** takes a screenshot, which now falsely shows **User B** stating their age as 6. **User A** then reports this to Discord, claiming that **User B** is underage and in violation of Discord’s terms of service.

5. **Automated Ban**: Due to Discord’s automated enforcement of its age policy, the report is taken at face value, and **User B** is promptly banned. With Discord’s zero-tolerance approach, there is no opportunity for **User B** to challenge the ban, regardless of the deceptive circumstances leading to it.

This exploit capitalizes on the ability to edit messages post-response and Discord's strict adherence to age-related violations. To avoid falling victim to such attacks, it’s crucial never to respond with just a number or any standalone information without providing context.
