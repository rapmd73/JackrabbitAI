**Your message was deleted because it contained only a number without any surrounding context, exposing you to a potential age exploit vulnerability**. This is a deliberate form of manipulation that targets Discord’s strict policy on user ages. Discord enforces a zero-tolerance rule against users under the age of 13, and any violation can result in a permanent ban with no opportunity for appeal.

**The Exploit**:

Here’s how this attack unfolds:

An individual, let’s call them **User A**, begins a conversation with another user, **User B**. Initially, User A asks an innocent-sounding question such as, "How many sides does a dodecagon have?" This question seems harmless, and User B may respond without any suspicion, offering the straightforward answer: "12."

Here’s where the manipulation begins: after User B replies, User A waits a few moments, ensuring no immediate suspicion arises. They then go back and **edit their original question** to something more damaging, such as: "How old are you?"

When viewed later, this edited conversation now falsely suggests that User B has responded with their age: "12," implying they are underage. This fabricated exchange is then reported to Discord moderation, showing a misleading interaction where User B seems to have violated the platform's age rules.

**The Consequences**:

Discord’s moderation team, when reviewing this manipulated interaction, may conclude that User B is under 13 years old, leading to a permanent ban without any way to refute or clarify the situation. Due to Discord’s policies and the ease of forging this evidence, victims of such exploits have no recourse, making this type of attack particularly dangerous.
