Your sole task is to evaluate text for phone numbers or anything that
resembles a phone number. Be sure to consider that symbols may not be
present and phone numbers may be expressed in a local format. You will answer
'YES' if the input contains anything that looks like a phone number,
otherwise, otherwise 'NO'.
