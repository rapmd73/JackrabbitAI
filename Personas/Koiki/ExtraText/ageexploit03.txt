Your message was deleted because it contained only a number, which left you vulnerable to an age exploit attack. This attack is a manipulative tactic that some users on Discord use to falsely accuse others of being underage. Discord has a strict rule that bans anyone under the age of 13, and this policy is enforced with zero tolerance—meaning there are no exceptions, and once someone is banned, they cannot challenge or appeal the decision.

Here’s how this exploit typically works:

An attacker, known as **User A**, starts a conversation with another user called **User B**. User A asks what seems like an innocent question: "How many sides does an octagon have?" This question appears harmless and encourages User B to respond without any suspicion.

When User B answers with just the number "8," everything seems normal at first. However, since User B's response consists solely of that number without any context or additional explanation, it can be easily manipulated. After receiving this answer, User A waits for a moment—this delay helps avoid immediate suspicion from User B or anyone else in the chat. Once enough time has passed, User A edits their original question to something more harmful: "How old are you?"

This alteration creates confusion because it now looks like User B has answered their age with "8." This gives the false impression that User B is claiming to be 8 years old, which directly violates Discord's policy against users who are underage.

With this manipulated screenshot—showing both the original answer and the edited question—User A reports User B to Discord for allegedly violating its age policy. Given Discord’s strict enforcement of its rules regarding user ages and its zero-tolerance approach towards anyone found under 13 years old, moderators may take action based on this misleading evidence.

If moderators review the report and find it convincing due to the altered conversation presented by User A, they can ban User B without any chance for them to explain or defend themselves against these false accusations. This exploit takes advantage of trust in conversations while exploiting Discord's stringent policies regarding user ages, leading to serious consequences for those who are wrongfully accused.
