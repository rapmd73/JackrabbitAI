# Delete files older then X days
# 2025 Copyright © Robert APM Darin
# All rights reserved unconditionally.

# This Python script is designed to help manage file storage by automatically
# removing files that are older than a specified number of days. Its primary
# purpose is to keep directories organized and free up space by deleting
# outdated files. The script begins by setting up the necessary tools and
# libraries it needs to function, such as functions for handling file operations
# and mechanisms to manage errors gracefully. It also establishes a way to
# measure time, which is essential for determining how old a file is.

# At the heart of the script is a function called `DeleteOldFiles`. This
# function takes a directory path and an optional threshold, which defaults to
# 31 days, as inputs. It first checks if the provided path is a valid directory.
# If it is, the script examines each file within that directory, skipping any
# files that start with a dot, as these are typically system or hidden files.
# For each regular file, it checks the date when the file was last modified. If
# the file’s last modification date is older than the specified threshold, the
# script attempts to delete it. If the deletion is successful, it keeps track of
# how many files were removed. If there’s an issue deleting a file, it displays
# an error message.

# The script includes a safety feature called a 'GuardRail,' which is a list of
# critical system directories that should never be cleaned. Before processing
# any directory, the script checks if it matches any of these protected paths.
# If a match is found, the directory is skipped to prevent accidental deletion
# of important system files.

# The main part of the script is executed when the program is run directly. It
# expects the user to provide two types of inputs: the number of days
# (threshold) and one or more directory paths to clean. If the inputs are
# missing, it informs the user and exits. It then processes each directory,
# applying the `DeleteOldFiles` function and reporting how many files were
# deleted from each location. This ensures the user is aware of the changes made
# by the script. Additionally, there is an optional verbose mode that, when
# enabled, lists directories even if no files were deleted, providing more
# detailed feedback to the user.
